# API Sync Skill

You are synchronizing the Basecamp SDK's Smithy spec against upstream API changes.

## Inputs

- **mode**: `{{ arguments.mode | default: "check" }}`

## Upstream repos

- **bc3-api** (API reference docs): `basecamp/bc3-api` — watch `sections/`
- **bc3** (Rails app): `basecamp/bc3` — watch `app/controllers/`

## Phase 1: Load State

1. Read `spec/api-provenance.json` to get the last-synced revisions for `bc3_api` and `bc3`.

## Phase 2: Check Upstream

List files changed in the watched paths since the last sync.

For **bc3-api** (API reference docs — `sections/` only):
```bash
gh api repos/basecamp/bc3-api/compare/<bc3_api.revision>...HEAD \
  --jq '[.files[] | select(.filename | startswith("sections/"))] |
    if length == 0 then "  (no changes in sections/)"
    else .[] | .status[:1] + " " + .filename
    end'
```

For **bc3** (Rails app — `app/controllers/` only):
```bash
gh api repos/basecamp/bc3/compare/<bc3.revision>...HEAD \
  --jq '[.files[] | select(.filename | startswith("app/controllers/"))] |
    if length == 0 then "  (no changes in app/controllers/)"
    else .[] | .status[:1] + " " + .filename
    end'
```

Summarize the changed files by API domain (todos, messages, people, etc.). If there are no changes in either repo, report "up to date" and stop.

If mode is `check`, stop here after reporting what changed.

## Phase 3: Sync Spec (mode=sync only)

For each changed section file in bc3-api:

1. Fetch the upstream doc:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/basecamp/bc3-api/contents/sections/<file>.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d
   ```
2. Read the corresponding Smithy operations in `spec/basecamp.smithy` and `spec/overlays/`
3. Identify gaps: missing operations, changed fields, new parameters
4. Propose specific Smithy changes and apply after confirmation

For controller changes in bc3, cross-reference with the API docs to identify behavioral changes that affect the spec.

## Phase 4: Regenerate (mode=sync only)

After spec changes are applied:

```bash
make smithy-build
make -C go generate
make url-routes
make ts-generate && make ts-generate-services
make rb-generate && make rb-generate-services
make provenance-sync
make check
```

Fix any issues that arise during generation or checks.

## Phase 5: Update Revisions (mode=sync or update-rev)

Get the current HEAD of each upstream repo:
```bash
gh api repos/basecamp/bc3-api/commits/HEAD --jq '.sha'
gh api repos/basecamp/bc3/commits/HEAD --jq '.sha'
```

Write the new revisions and today's date to `spec/api-provenance.json`:
```json
{
  "bc3_api": {
    "revision": "<new-sha>",
    "date": "<today>"
  },
  "bc3": {
    "revision": "<new-sha>",
    "date": "<today>"
  }
}
```

Then run `make provenance-sync` to update the Go embedded copy.

## Output

Report a summary of:
- What changed upstream (by domain)
- What spec changes were made (if sync mode)
- New revision SHAs stamped
- Any warnings or issues encountered
